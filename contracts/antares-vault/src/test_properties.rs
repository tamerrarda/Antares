//! I1 and I5 over arbitrary call sequences — `06-TEST-PLAN.md` §3, Phase 2's half.
//!
//! I1–I10 comes at Phase 4. These two are here because they are the two that can
//! be asserted without a settlement path, and because they are the two whose
//! violation costs someone their principal rather than a wrong number in a record.
//!
//! **Asserted after every call, not at the end.** A sequence that ends solvent
//! having passed through an insolvent state is not solvent — the intermediate
//! state is one a real transaction could have observed, and I1 quantifies over
//! reachable states rather than final ones.
//!
//! # What is exercised, stated rather than implied
//!
//! I1's five terms are all asserted, so the assertion needs no edit when the
//! remaining paths land. But only three of them can currently *move*:
//!
//! | term | moved by | exercised here |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `locked_assets` | deposit, redeem, instant withdraw, finalization | yes |
//! | `pending_deposits_total` | deposit during a live round, cancel, redeem | yes |
//! | `withdraw_claimable_total` | finalization, claim | yes |
//! | `bidder_claimable_total` | settlement and the bidder claims | **no — `bid` is DEV3's and unwritten** |
//! | `fee_claimable` | settlement | **no — a fee accrues only on a round that sold something** |
//!
//! With no `bid`, no round can fill, so every round lapses and the last two terms
//! stay at zero. **The suite reports that rather than leaving it to be assumed**:
//! `observed_liabilities` records the maximum each term reached, and the test
//! asserts the three that should move did. A five-term assertion over a
//! three-term state is exactly the "green but proves less than it claims" shape
//! this project keeps finding, and naming it is the only defence available until
//! Phase 4.
//!
//! I5 is worth more now than it would have been two blocks ago. Until SEP-41
//! landed, shares moved only through mint and burn — both in one file, both mine.
//! Now `transfer`, `transfer_from`, `burn_from` and `request_withdraw` all write
//! balances, and `request_withdraw` burns immediately while the pending record it
//! creates does not. **Four writers, one sum.**
